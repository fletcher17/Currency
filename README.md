# Currency
This is a currency app which consumes fixerApi that helps convert currencis and give real time conversion rate.
The api had different membership options, however, i used the free account which i have used up the api usage for the month.
This app was built using the Kotlin, Jetpack Library, Navigation and MVVM with Clean Architecture Structure.
